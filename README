== Overview ==

Page Exchange is an extension to MediaWiki that allows for defining "packages"
of wiki pages that administrators can install (and un-install) on their wikis.

Packages are defined in JSON files, which admins can make available for their
wikis by adding those files' URLs to the $wgPageExchangePackageFiles global
variable.
